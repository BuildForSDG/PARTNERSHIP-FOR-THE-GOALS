About:

DevData is a solution that provides high quality, timely, relevant and reliable data about software 
developers around the globe, country by country, state by state. We seek to provide comprehensive 
statistics and analysis that give relevant insights about current state of software developers in 
all locations around the globe in order to aid governments and concerned bodies in making plans
and policies that benefits societies. We also seek to provide information about relevant opportunities 
in the software development field. A future we forsee is a point where we wouldn't just provide these 
insights for software development field but for all fields in the world. 


Stack_Overflow:

One of the largest community of developers around the globe, Stack Overflow, with over 19.6 million 
questions asked, and more than 16 million answered, stack overflow has positioned itself over the years, 
as an indespensible learning tool for developers around the globe, especially beginners. Unsurprisingly,
current data (of about 14,000 top developers) shows most stack overflow developers are from the United 
states of America, coming up with the best ratings in overall. However, looking at developers at the 
level of continents, Europe seems to have the largest share, followed by North America, Asia, Oceania, 
Africa, South America. **continents_stats graph**

On digging deeper into respective continents, world powers seems to the hub for developers around the 
globe. The US alone has more than 1,500 developers out of the 14,000 top dvelopers. Fellow North American 
country, Canada has more than 600. That means the US and Canada alone has about 15% of world's top 14,000 
developers. How amazing that is. Only India has more developers here than Canada with close to 800 top 
developers. More than a hundred countries has below 50 with around 20 having a value less than 5. Below 
are graphs that gives more insights on developers in all continents. The order is in sorted alphabetic from
with zero(0) representing the first country in each continent in the alphabetical order and like that till
the last country. **copy of countries by continents**, **all continental graphs**

Talking about popular language among this top developers, Python is undoubtedly the champion and the next 
is java, followed by others. **Stack_language_stats graph**

Out of the over 16 million answers given so far on stack overflow, these top 14,000 have given a whooping amount
very close to 6 million while there are over 12 million users of stack overflow. Seemingly, top 1 million 
developers on stack overflow would be the sole contributor of these answers, likely having more than 90% of these
answers. The question is, how much contribution would the other 11 million developers currently on stack overflow 
make? This question seemingly provide reasons of why we have more than 2.5 million questions unanswered on stack 
overflow. In fact, at the first quater of this year, the number of unanswered questions stood at around 1.9 million.
But now, we're having more than 2.5 million, that's a tremendous growth and if this growth continues, stack overflow
may begin to fail in it's purpose. 

The ever changing and rapidly evolving situation of today's technologies in software development leaves quite a numver
of answers on stack overflow obsolete, whereas more people try to get into software development day by day. Not finding 
answers to bothering questions leaves learners fustrated and could slow the rate of learning, if not crush it. Experienced
developers perhaps, need to pay more attention on giving back to communities like stack overflow to better the future of
upcoming beginners.
